 A research paper on a supposed adhesin functional domain of C. auris.

C. auris has recently emerged as a lethal threat in clinical settings due to its multidrug
resistance. This danger is compounded by strong adhesive properties that make it difficult to
remove from medical equipment (Kean et al. 2018). The proteins that give this adhesiveness
have not yet been fully investigated, limiting the range of possible countermeasures (Muñoz et
al. 2018; Kean et al. 2018).

My research aim was to investigate the uncharacterized C. auris protein CJI97_000055 to
determine if it is an adhesin that contributes to C. auris’s strong adhesive properties. An
InterProScan search revealed that CJI97_000055 contains a large segment belonging to the
glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored superfamily, which has been implicated as a unique
contributor to C. auris’s tenacious stickiness to medical devices (Kean et al. 2018; Muñoz et al.
2018). The GPI anchor is a modification added to the C-terminus of proteins after translation
that allows the modified protein to be anchored in the cell membrane’s outer leaflet, in some
cases contributing to cell-cell contact and adhesion (Paulick and Bertozzi, 2008). Several of the
analyses I undertook will be detailed in this paper, including a multiple sequence alignment of
homologs, phylogenetic trees, 3D protein structure prediction, and motif discovery.
